# Police_Shootings
A project on police shootings since 2015

The following is an analysis on law enforcement shootings over the past 7-years in the United States where the individual shot died.

The Rule of Law is a critical fiber within the fabric of of US society and is largely what keeps much of daily life safe and functioning.

The Rule of Law is enforced through policing and has come under intense scrutinay in the last 3-5 years largely due to high-profile events many of which include law-enforcement involved shootings. Especially those where the individual died.

Despite these events actually being extremely rare from a statistical perspective, each one tends to have a tremendous impact (at least for the initial time period) on society. Protests, riots, and other events along with impact on elections and ultimately how people feel in their daily lives are all a direct result of these events.

Better understanding what is occuring from a "math" & "data" perspective that is objective has the potential to abate much of the fear and to help drive a realisitic discussion on how to at least reduce and at best eliminate these type of encounters.
